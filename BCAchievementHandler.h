/**
 * Game Center has a notification window that slides down and informs the GKLocalPlayer 
 * that they've been authenticated. The BCAchievementNotificationView classes are a way to 
 * display achievements awarded to the player in the same manner; more similar to Xbox Live 
 * style achievement popups. The achievement dialogs are added to the UIWindow view of your application.
 *
 * The BCAchievementHandler is a singleton pattern that you can use to 
 * notify the user anywhere in your application that they earned an achievement.
